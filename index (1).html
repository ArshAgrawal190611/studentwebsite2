        <p class="text muted">Church and school are two of the biggest parts of my life. My first memories are going to church and school, because that is all I’ve ever focused on. I don’t play sports, so I spend my free nights after school and weekends studying for tests and going to church.  My summers consist of working and volunteering in church programs. My biggest priority in life will always be excelling in my faith and learning to work as a team. One quality that has always stuck with me through the 17 years of my life is leadership. Whether it was me organizing the games my sister and I would play when we were younger, or being the one person to start a class discussion on the first day of school when everyone else was too shy to muster something up.</p>

        <p class="text-muted">In my school library, we have various types of books- fictional, non-fictional, literature, books on general knowledge, etc. I love to read storybooks and books on general knowledge which have colourful illustrations. Books in my school library are arranged in such a way that students can find them easily.</p>

        <p class="text-muted">School auditoriums have now been quite common in many schools of the subcontinent. This trend makes the topic important for English comprehension tests such as report writing. Such reports are generally written in the pattern of magazine reports but can also be framed in the pattern of newspaper reports in some cases.

          In today's session, I am going to show exactly how you can write a report on the inauguration of the school auditorium in both the relevant patterns. For your initial clarification, three sample reports will be written on the magazine report pattern, and one will be a newspaper report. The category of every report will be mentioned prior to the samples.</p>
